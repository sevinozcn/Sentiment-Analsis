In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis application using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. With the increasing use of social media in recent years, the need to analyze opinions shared on social media has been growing. In this context, I aimed to create a program that can analyze whether people's written opinions are positive or negative. Using user reviews collected from the Hepsiburada website, the program determines the sentiment of the reviews as either positive or negative. This program can evaluate the sentiment of comments using both an existing dataset and user-generated comments. While developing this program, I used NLP techniques, NLTK, and the GRU training method.
